# AI Projects

- Repository of projects completed in Post-AP Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence during the 2020 - 2021 school year
- Course closely followed UC Berkeley's CS 188 course syllabus, material, and projects
- Apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning
- Repository also includes basic image clssification neural net

## [Search](search)

- Depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms
- Algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world

## [Multi-Agent Search](multiagent)

- Classic Pacman modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem
- Multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms
- Designed evaluation functions

## [Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement)

- Model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms
- Applied to AIMA textbookâ€™s Gridworld and Pacman

## [BNs and HMMs: Ghostbusters](ghostbusters)
